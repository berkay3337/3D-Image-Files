# 3D Image Files
Operations on 3D image file coordinates
We are doing some operations on coordinates.
We are reading coordinates from files.
We save these coordinates in the matrix.
There are 5 five choice.
if you choose 1:This program will control file's title format is true or false and if there is a missing coordinate information program find this coordinate.For example 156.coordinate information is missing.
if you choose 2:Program will calculate the furthest from each other and the nearest from each other.
For example: 2304 and 192 the furthest , 4203 and 306 the nearest.
if you choose 3:Program will calculate cube which is contain all of the coordinates.
if you choose 4:Program will want two things from you.First thing  you should enter x y z coordinate informations and then you should enter radius information you can enter mixed.
Program will calculate with this information a sphere and then write coordinates which is remaining in the sphere.
if you choose 5:Program will calculate distance of points to each other and find an average with this information.
